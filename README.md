# Student Information System

This is a Python program that manages student information using loops, lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, and file handling. Data is saved in `students.csv` and can be loaded or displayed as needed.

## Features

- **Add students** with ID, name, age, and multiple grades.
- **Display all students** (from memory or from file), including a grade matrix showing each student's name and grades.
- **Update student information** (name, age, grades).
- **Delete student records**.
- **Save student data to file** (`students.csv`).
- **Load student data from file** on startup or on request.
- **Menu-driven interface** with continuous loop until exit.

## Python Concepts Demonstrated

- **Loops:** While loop for menu, for loop to display students, nested loop for grades, break & continue in menu.
- **Lists:** Grades stored as lists, list operations (access, update, delete, slicing, matrix-like).
- **Tuples:** Student ID and name stored as a tuple, tuple built-ins (`len()`, `max()`, `min()`).
- **Dictionaries:** Main data structure for student records, demonstration of `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`.
- **Functions:** Each operation is a function; shows required, keyword, default, and lambda arguments.
- **File Handling:** CSV file read/write for persistent storage.
- **Scope:** Demonstrates local vs global variables.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Place `student.py` and `students.csv` in the same directory.
3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python student.py
   ```

4. Use the menu to add, display, update, delete, save, or load students.
